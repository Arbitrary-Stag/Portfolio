# Portfolio

## Description
This is the second challenge of the UC Berkeley Web Development bootcamp in which we were challenged to create a functional portfolio website to host our future projects built from the ground up with just HTML and CSS.

## Installation 
N/A

## Usage
Once you have navigated to the webpage you will be greeted by my smiling face and brief about me section. At the top is navigation bar with which you can jump to different parts of the page. Further down you will find four humorous placehold project cards that over time will be replaced with real coding projects. At the very bottom of the page you will find various ways of contacting me as well as links to my GitHub and LinkedIn profiles.

## Credits
I wrote a significant amount of this code myself. However, I at times used my classmate John Owen's submissions as a guide, and I used google and youtube extensively when I would run into problems.
